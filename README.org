- Split passwords into sections, specifically, letters of the alphabet
  - Use language-specific character frequencies (at the start of words) to
    decide the quantity of passwords for a specific letter's section.
- Implement feedback from users:
  - un-biased random number transformation: https://www.pcg-random.org/posts/bounded-rands.html
  - consider more renowned CSPRNGs, such as ChaCha20

  - explain how/why these passwords are secure
  - answer their questions:
    - why does each password start with a number?
    - what is the exact function of a letter [the section headers]?
    - what's the seed phrase for?
    - how to recover using the seed phrase?
    - what makes the seed phrase valid?
    - why did you make it ("This for fun? For GitHub? Or to Monetise")?
    - maybe just add an explainer paragraph at the top?
    - how is the book itself protected?
